### About Me
I'm a climate researcher and data scientist at the University of Arizona. My research focuses on paleoclimate data assimilation. I'm the author and developer of DASH, a Matlab package for paleoclimate data assimilation workflow, as well as other climate-related projects. Check out [my website](https://jonking93.github.io) for more details about my work.

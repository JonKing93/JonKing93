# About Me
I'm a Mendenhall postdoc at the USGS, where I'm currently developing tools for postfire debris-flow hazard assessments. Previously, I completed a doctorate in climatology at the University of Arizona, where I specialized in paleoclimate data assimilation. I'm the author of several geoscientific software libraries - these include the USGS's [pfdf](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/lhp/pfdf/) and [wildcat](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/lhp/wildcat/) packages, as well as the [DASH](https://jonking93.github.io/DASH/welcome.html) Matlab toolbox. I'm interested in natural hazards, climate change, and supporting open science. Check out [my website](https://jonking93.github.io) for more details about my work.
